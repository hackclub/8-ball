This Slack bot is made for the #8-ball channel on the Hack Club Slack. It's hosted by Heroku and uses the DaVinci-002 model by OpenAi.

The 8-ball bot is only programmed to answer questions so it doesn't remember your conversations. Due to this fact, some of its answers may sound cringe and hard to understand! Its responses are often remarkably profound and detailed.

The 8-ball bot is an open-source project. Its code is very easy to understand. Try reading it and make your own bot! Good luck!
